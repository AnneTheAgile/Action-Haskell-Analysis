# Action-Haskell-Analysis

*This is your AHA! Haskell Moment*

This study group will cover several chapters of the [Haskell Data Analysis Cookbook](http://haskelldata.com) during Spring 2015. You'll need a copy of the book (*members of the [NY Haskell](http://meeetup.com/ny-haskell) group can access a copy from the files section*). The most recent code examples from the book can be found at the author's GitHub Repo [https://github.com/BinRoot/Haskell-Data-Analysis-Cookbook](https://github.com/BinRoot/Haskell-Data-Analysis-Cookbook).

**Spring 2015 Schedule**

Please come to each session prepared, with working version of GHC 7.6+ installed and a text editor of choice. Our intention is to have participants go through the selected chapters themselves and work through the code exercises and bring the finished examples to the study group for discussion. That said, you will need to bring your laptop to the study group.
